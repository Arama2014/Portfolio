    <p>I come from a<span> dynamic</span> professional background that spans the <span>corporate</span> world to the world of the <span>arts</span>.  

      I've worked part-time as a personal assistant for <span>internationally</span> known <span>collage artist</span> Michael Anderson. My responsibilities included scheduling domestic and international <span>travel</span> and lodging arrangements, keeping inventory of art supplies, ordering <span>inventory</span> as needed, and managing Mr. Anderson's calendar. Highlights include organizing and facilitating the marketing and <span>social media campaign</span> for Mr. Anderson's <span>live installation</span> experience at<span> Coachella 2014</span> at the Heineken sponsored<span> performance</span> stage. I have extensive experience in fine arts and performance in an administrative capacity. <span>Technical</span> skills I've gained include proficiency in all Microsoft Office programs, Adobe Photoshop, web design using basic <span>HTML/CSS</span>.

As a Data Entry Clerk for Cast and Crew, I processed payroll and handled <span>confidential tax</span> documents for <span>actors</span> and crew members under intense time pressure. I also handled day-to-day <span>administrative</span> Because of my speed and efficiency in typing, I consistently met the company's daily quota for data entry <span>assignments</span>. 

  Additionally, for the past six years I have worked as a <span>songwriter</span> and composer. Songwriting highlights include working with <span>Miley Cyrus</span> and writing the theme song for the final season of Hannah Montana, writing for pop artists <span>Kelis</span>, Sean Paul, <span>Diplo</span>, Akon,<span> Lil Wayne</span> and Enrique Iglesias. I have a <span>love</span> for the arts and all things <span>creative</span> and I am seeking to continue to utilize my <span>business/administrative</span> skills and creativity, where needed, in the <span>tech</span>  or creative industry.
 
What I've gained the most from a broad range of diverse professional environments are excellent listening skills, a professional attitude and a self -starting nature.</p> </div>
